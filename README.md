# Clean-Blog
As an aspiring web developer, this is my first project of putting HTML and CSS together. It is a replication of a static homepage of http://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog/
<hr>
<b>What this project taught me</b>
<ol>
<li>I structured and styled a static webpage using HTML and CSS.</li>
<li>I styled a responsive navigation bar and social media icons.</li>
<li>I also got to play with buttons.</li>
</ol>

This is a very basic project I know, but I hope to get better with time. I'm working towards it. :)
